# Graph Theory Basics
 
- What is a graph: Understanding graphs as data structures, including vertices (nodes) and edges (connections).

- Types of Graphs:
  - Undirected vs. Directed
  - Weighted vs. Unweighted
  - Cyclic vs. Acyclic
  - Special Graphs: Trees, DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs), and bipartite graphs.

- Graph Representation:
  - Adjacency Matrix
  - Adjacency List

- Key Terminologies:
  - Degree, Path, Cycle, Connectivity, etc.

# Basic Graph Traversal Algorithms

 - Depth-First Search (DFS):
   - Recursive and iterative implementations.
   - Use cases and applications (e.g., cycle detection, pathfinding).
 - Breadth-First Search (BFS):
   - Queue-based implementation.
   - Applications (e.g., shortest path in unweighted graphs).

# Shortest Path Algorithms

- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:** Finding the shortest path in weighted graphs.
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** Dealing with graphs containing negative weights.

# Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithms
- **Kruskal’s Algorithm:** Using union-find for edge selection.
- **Prim’s Algorithm:** Greedy approach using priority queues.
- **Applications of MST:** Network design, clustering, etc.


# Advanced Graph Algorithms

- **Topological Sorting:** Sorting vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- **Strongly Connected Components (SCC):**
    - Kosaraju’s Algorithm
    - Tarjan’s Algorithm
- **Network Flow Algorithms:**
    - **Ford-Fulkerson Method:** Basic approach for maximum flow.
    - **Edmonds-Karp Algorithm:** BFS-based for finding maximum flow.
    - **Applications:** Network optimization, matching problems.


# Practice Problems and Optimization Techniques
- Implement various algorithms on common problem-solving platforms (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank).
- Optimize solutions for large inputs and improve space complexity.
